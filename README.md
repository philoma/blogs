Why use Softmax with Categorical Cross-Entropy, and NOT Sigmoid?
Let’s break it down simply and clearly.


🚦 Softmax vs Sigmoid — Why Softmax Wins in Multi-Class
Feature	      Sigmoid  	                                Softmax
Output Range	0 to 1	                                  0 to 1
Sum of Outputs	❌ Not necessarily 1	                  ✅ Always = 1
Class Type	Multi-label (independent classes)          	Multi-class (1 correct class)
Best For	"Is it A? Is it B?" (multiple yes/no)	        "Which 1 class is correct?"

🎯 In Multi-Class Classification (only one correct class), you need the network to choose one class out of many.
That requires a probability distribution where:

Only one class should dominate

All probabilities must compete → total = 1

👉 Sigmoid fails here because it treats each class independently.

❌ Why Sigmoid is Wrong for Multi-Class Classification
Example with 3 Classes:

With sigmoid, you might get:

[0.7, 0.6, 0.8]


These do not sum to 1

The model thinks all three are likely, which makes no sense when only one class is correct

✅ Why Softmax is Correct

With softmax, you get:

[0.90, 0.05, 0.05]


✔ Clear single winner → Class 1
✔ Sum = 1 → Valid probability distribution
✔ Perfect for Categorical Cross-Entropy

🧠 Final One-Line Answer

Sigmoid treats each class independently (multi-label), while Softmax forces competition and produces a probability distribution (multi-class). That's why Softmax is used with categorical cross-entropy.

Left: The full surface 
𝑧=𝑥2+𝑦2z=x2+y2 — a 3D paraboloid.

Right: A horizontal slice (level curve) at 𝑧=1. 
x2+y2=1 

This shows the key idea:

The function itself is not a circle — it's a curved 3D surface.

But any constant height slice is a circle in the 
𝑥𝑦 xy-plane. 



The formula shown in the image is correct. It represents the multivariable chain rule when a function 
ℎ depends on two inner functions f(x) and 𝑔(𝑥) both of which depend on 𝑥
